# mfnn

mfnn is a neural network that predicts hourly bike rentals from [Capital Bikeshare](http://www.capitalbikeshare.com). It trains on data from the [UCI Machine Learning Respository Bike Sharing Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset). This is a refactored version of the project ["My First Neural Network"](http://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/first-neural-network) I submitted as required by the Udacity Machine Learning Foundations Nanodegree Program.
