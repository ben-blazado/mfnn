# mfnn

mfnn is a neural network that trains on past bike usage, weather, and holiday data, to create estimates of future bike usage. The data is from the UCI Machine Learning Respository Bike Sharing Dataset. This is a refactored version of the project ["My First Neural Network"](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/first-neural-network) of the Udacity Machine Learning Foundations Nanodegree Program.
